# 🎵 Spotify Clone - Music Player Web App

---

A fully responsive music player web app that mimics Spotify's interface and basic functionality — built using *HTML, **CSS, and **JavaScript* (Vanilla JS).

## 🚀 Features

- 🎧 Play/Pause songs
- 🧭 Seek bar with live progress
- ⏮ Next/Previous song controls
- 📂 Folder-based dynamic song loading
- 🔊 Volume control
- 🎵 Dynamic playlist generation
- 📱 Fully responsive for all screen sizes
- 🔁 Album switching via card UI
- ⚙ Clean UI with DOM manipulation and event handling

> Make sure to run this on a local server (e.g., using *Live Server* in VS Code) or set up a basic Node/Express static server since fetch() won’t work properly via file://.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- *HTML5* – Structure
- *CSS3* – Styling (Fully responsive)
- *JavaScript (ES6+)* – Logic & interactivity (DOM, async/await, event handling)
